## üéØ Goals of the Project

1. **Categorize Smartphones by Price Range**: Identify and analyze the distribution of smartphones across different price segments.
2. **Average User Ratings by Brand**: Calculate and compare the average user ratings for various smartphone brands to determine customer satisfaction.
3. **Processor Type Evaluation**: Assess user ratings based on different processor types to understand performance preferences.
4. **Price and Memory Card Support Analysis**: Examine the relationship between smartphone prices and the availability of memory card support.
5. **Battery Capacity and Processor Speed Analysis**: Analyze average ratings and prices based on different processor speed ranges.
6. **Top Budget-Friendly Models**: Identify top-rated, affordable smartphone models for budget-conscious consumers.
7. **Market Share Analysis**: Evaluate the market share of different smartphone brands.
8. **Display Resolution Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of smartphone display resolutions in the market.
9. **Camera Megapixel Trends**: Track the evolution of camera megapixel trends over time.
10. **Memory Card Support Comparison**: Compare memory card support across various brands.
11. **Camera Setup Analysis**: Analyze the impact of different camera setups on smartphone prices and ratings.
12. **High Ratings and Low Price Models**: Identify smartphone models that offer high user ratings at relatively low prices.

This analysis provides valuable insights to consumers for making informed purchasing decisions and helps manufacturers understand market trends and consumer preferences to develop better products.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup and Implementation

### 1. **Importing Libraries**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

## 2. **Use SQL Connector in the Project**

In this project, we use an SQL connector to interact with our database. The SQL connector allows us to establish a connection between our Python scripts and the database, execute SQL queries, and fetch results for analysis. This helps us efficiently retrieve and manipulate the data needed for our analysis of the smartphone market.

```python
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="root",
  password="**********",
  database="project_02"
)

mydb
```

## 3. Show All Tables in the Database

```python
df = pd.read_sql_query(
    """
    SHOW TABLES
    """, mydb)
df
```

## 4. Describe the 'smartphone' Table

```python
df = pd.read_sql_query(
    """
    DESCRIBE smartphone
    """, mydb)
df
```
