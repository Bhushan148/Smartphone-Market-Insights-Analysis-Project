# Smartphone-Market-Insights-Analysis-Project

This project aims to provide a clear and detailed understanding of the smartphone market. We analyze various aspects such as prices, features, user ratings, and technical specifications of different smartphone models using SQL queries.

## Project Description

The dataset includes detailed information about each smartphone model, such as its price, battery life, camera quality, processor type, and more. By running these SQL queries, we uncover important trends and patterns. This information can help consumers make better choices when buying a smartphone and assist manufacturers in developing better products.

## Key Analyses

1. **Price Analysis**
2. **Battery Life Comparison**
3. **Camera Quality Evaluation**
4. **Processor Type Distribution**
5. **User Ratings Overview**
6. **Trends in Features Over Time**
7. **Brand-Specific Insights**
8. **Memory Card Support Comparison**
9. **High-Value Smartphones**
10. **Overall Market Trends**
